    "\n",
    "1. Read in `hw11_data.npy`. The dataset should consist of $1000$ samples with $2$ features. Note that the last column are the labels, not another feature. Make a $2$-D scatter plot of the data colored by their labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start with kernel density estimation on the data set. First, perform a grid search $5$-fold cross-validation to find the best bandwidth, testing $30$ bandwidths between $0.1$ and $1.0$. What is this best bandwidth? Using this best bandwidth, plot the two-dimensional kernel density estimate of the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now try a nearest neighbors approach to estimating the density. Use the Bayesian nearest neighbors option. Plot the estimated distribution. What value of $k$ neighbors do you need to make the plot look similar to your KDE distribution?\n"
